**[Open Page in Private Window](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/open-page-in-private-window/)** is a Firefox extension that enables you to easily open a copy of the current page in a new Private Window. This is useful for reading articles on websites that limit the number of articles you can read per month. This extension does not clear your browsing history or close the original tab. You can activate this extension from the "Open Page in Private Window" context menu item or an optional toolbar button.

You can [install the extension from Mozilla's Add-ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/open-page-in-private-window/) or [download the code from GitHub](https://github.com/cpeterso/Open-Page-in-Private-Window/).
